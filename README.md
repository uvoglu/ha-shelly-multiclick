# Home Assistant Shelly Multiclick

This integration is a fork of the [built-in Shelly integration](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/tree/dev/homeassistant/components/shelly) of Home Assistant. It overrides some functionality to allow detecting multi-click events.

The code is originally based on this [PR](https://github.com/home-assistant/core/pull/58436), which unfortunately got declined.

This integration includes the patches from then, adapted to the changes that happened to the integration since then.
